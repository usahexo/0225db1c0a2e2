        <h1 id="DraftKings-Casino-Could-be-Coming-to-Michigan-in-2017"><a href="#DraftKings-Casino-Could-be-Coming-to-Michigan-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="DraftKings Casino Could be Coming to Michigan in 2017"></a>DraftKings Casino Could be Coming to Michigan in 2017</h1><p>As of January 2017, there is no word on whether DraftKings will offer casino games in Michigan. However, the company has expressed an interest in doing so and is currently awaiting a ruling from the state government.</p>
<p>Michigan laws regarding online casinos are a little murky, but it appears that DraftKings would be able to offer casino games if they partner with an established casino in the state. This would allow them to bypass some of the regulations that are currently in place.</p>
<p>There are many who believe that DraftKings Casino would be a huge success in Michigan. The company has a large following in the state and has already created a buzz around their potential casino products.</p>
<p>If DraftKings Casino does come to Michigan, it will face some competition from existing operators such as MGM and Caesars. However, the company is confident that they can compete and expects to see significant growth in this market.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-Residents-Could-be-Able-to-Play-DraftKings-Casino-Games-by-End-of-the-Year"><a href="#Michigan-Residents-Could-be-Able-to-Play-DraftKings-Casino-Games-by-End-of-the-Year" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Residents Could be Able to Play DraftKings Casino Games by End of the Year"></a>Michigan Residents Could be Able to Play DraftKings Casino Games by End of the Year</h1><p>Michigan Residents Could be Able to Play DraftKings Casino Games by End of the Year</p>
<p>The Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB) is currently reviewing a proposal from daily fantasy sports operator DraftKings that would allow the company to offer casino games in the state. If approved, residents of Michigan could start playing DraftKings casino games by the end of the year.</p>
<p>DraftKings first announced its plans to enter the online casino space earlier this year. At the time, the company said it was in discussions with a number of states about potential partnerships. In addition to Michigan, DraftKings has also applied for a license in New Jersey.</p>
<p>“As we’ve said from the beginning, we are committed to expanding our product offering and bringing new experiences to our customers,” said DraftKings CEO Jason Robins in a statement announcing the Michigan application. “Online casinos present an exciting opportunity for us and we are thrilled to be seeking licensure in Michigan.”</p>
<p>If approved, Michigan would become only the second state where DraftKings offers casino games, behind New Jersey. The company already offers poker and sports betting in both states.</p>
<p>In its application, DraftKings requested permission to offer a range of casino games including slots, blackjack, and roulette. The company said it plans to partner with local casinos to offer real-money gambling services.</p>
<p>It’s not clear when the MGCB will make a decision on DraftKings’ application. However, given that there are only a few months left in the year, it’s likely that a decision won’t come until early 2020.</p>
<h1 id="DraftKings-Casino-Plans-to-Enter-the-Michigan-Gaming-Market"><a href="#DraftKings-Casino-Plans-to-Enter-the-Michigan-Gaming-Market" class="headerlink" title="DraftKings Casino Plans to Enter the Michigan Gaming Market"></a>DraftKings Casino Plans to Enter the Michigan Gaming Market</h1><p>DraftKings Casino, the online gambling arm of the Boston-based DraftKings Inc., announced plans this week to expand into the Michigan gaming market in early 2019.</p>
<p>The company said it has already begun seeking a state gaming license and anticipates launching its first online casino and poker offerings in Michigan by next spring.</p>
<p>Michigan is one of the four states (along with New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Indiana) where DraftKings currently operates a real-money online sportsbook. The company said it plans to launch an online casino product in each of those states.</p>
<p>Brian bash, DraftKings’s Head of Casino, said in a statement: “We are excited to bring our industry-leading casino product to Michigan players. We have seen tremendous success in our existing markets and believe that Michigan players will enjoy our innovative games and features.”</p>
<p>DraftKings Casino offers a wide range of slots, table games, and video poker titles from some of the world’s leading providers, including IGT, Scientific Games, and Evolution Gaming. The site also features live dealer games streamed from studios around the world.</p>
<p>In addition to its online casino offering, DraftKings also operates an online poker room which is currently available in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The poker product offers several unique features such as fast fold gameplay and a wide range of tournaments with buy-ins starting at just $0.25.</p>
<p>DraftKings Casino is licensed and regulated by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB). In order to operate in Michigan, the company will need to obtain a license from the Michigan Gaming Control Board (MGCB).</p>
<h1 id="DraftKings-Moves-Forward-with-casino-Plans-in-Michigan"><a href="#DraftKings-Moves-Forward-with-casino-Plans-in-Michigan" class="headerlink" title="DraftKings Moves Forward with casino Plans in Michigan"></a>DraftKings Moves Forward with casino Plans in Michigan</h1><p>DraftKings has announced its plans to open a casino in Michigan. The company is partnering with Greektown Casino-Hotel in Detroit to make the move.</p>
<p>Michigan is one of the few states that do not yet have regulated online gambling. This move by DraftKings could be seen as an attempt to get a foothold in the state should online gambling eventually be legalized there.</p>
<p>The casino will be housed in the Greektown complex and is expected to open in 2020. It will offer both casino games and sports betting.</p>
<p>DraftKings has been expanding rapidly into the casino industry. The company already operates casinos in New Jersey, Nevada, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Michigan officials have not yet commented on the plan by DraftKings.</p>
<h1 id="DraftKings-Could-be-Coming-to-a-Casino-Near-You-in-Michigan"><a href="#DraftKings-Could-be-Coming-to-a-Casino-Near-You-in-Michigan" class="headerlink" title="DraftKings Could be Coming to a Casino Near You in Michigan!"></a>DraftKings Could be Coming to a Casino Near You in Michigan!</h1><p>DraftKings, a popular daily fantasy sports site, is projected to make a major move into the casino market. This was announced in a recent filing with the Michigan Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>While it’s not clear exactly what form this move will take, it’s safe to say that Michigan residents can look forward to some exciting new gambling options in the near future!</p>
<p>What is DraftKings?</p>
<p>DraftKings is a web and mobile app-based platform that allows users to engage in daily fantasy sports contests. These contests can be between friends or against other players in order to win cash prizes.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2012 and has quickly become one of the most popular destinations for online fantasy sports betting. In fact, during the 2016 NFL season, DraftKings had over 1 million active users!</p>
<p>What Does This Mean for Michigan Residents?</p>
<p>With DraftKings making a move into the casino market, Michigan residents can expect some big changes on the horizon. It’s unclear exactly what form these changes will take, but we can expect new and exciting gambling options to start becoming available very soon.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that DraftKings has already partnered with several casinos in other states. So it’s likely that Michigan residents can look forward to similar arrangements in the near future.</p>
