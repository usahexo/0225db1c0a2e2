#  Big Fish Casino suffering from slow network according to users

One of the most popular casino gaming apps on mobile, Big Fish Casino, has been reportedly suffering from slow network lately.

The app, which is said to have over 52 million active users, has been downgraded by many of its fans due to the poor network conditions.

“It’s really frustrating because the gameplay is really good but the network always let us down. We either can’t get in or we get kicked out in the middle of a game,” said one user on a forum discussing the problem.

According to some users, trying to connect to the game servers is like “hitting a wall”. In fact, some have even gone as far as to say that it was “almost impossible” to play the game at all.

This is not the first time that Big Fish Casino has suffered from networking issues. Similar problems were reported back in 2016 but it seems that they have yet to be fixed.

In response to the complaints, Big Fish Casino has issued a statement saying that they are aware of the issue and are currently working on a solution.

#  Casino gratis experiencing lag for players

It’s no secret that online casinos are growing more popular by the day. In fact, casino gratis have become one of the most popular online gaming experiences in the world. Players from all corners of the globe flock to their favorite casino gratis website in order to enjoy hours of excitement and fun.

What many players may not know, however, is that casino gratis can experience lag times for players. This happens when the game lags or slows down for a player, significantly impacting the overall gaming experience. While this issue is not rampant, it can certainly occur frequently enough to be an annoyance for players.

There are a few things that you can do as a player to help minimize instances of lag while playing casino gratis. First, make sure that your internet connection is strong and reliable. If you notice that your internet connection slows down during peak hours, try to avoid playing casino gratis during those times. Additionally, make sure that you have the most current version of Flash installed on your computer – this can help reduce lag times as well.

If you are still experiencing lags while playing casino gratis, there are some things that you can do on the casino site itself to improve your experience. For example, many sites offer different video quality settings. You may want to experiment with these settings to see if one works better for you than another. Additionally, some sites allow you to change your computer’s skin or appearance. Doing so may help make the game look better and run more smoothly on your screen.

Ultimately, there is no perfect solution to resolving lag issues while playing casino gratis. However, by following the tips above, you can hopefully minimize any problems that you may encounter. So get out there and enjoy some exciting online gaming action – just be prepared for possible lag times along the way!
